# APM466 Projects and Assignments
In this repository, I have included all my assignments from the Mathematical Finance Course (APM466) from University of Toronto. 
## Final products from the assignments: 
- In assignment 1, I constructed the ytm curve, spot rate curve, 1-year future yield curve for Canadian Government bonds using bootstrapping and interpolation techniques.
